### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Matias Capeletto](https://patak.dev/). I'm a [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) core team member, a [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) core team member, and a [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/) team member, and I collaborate in Vue ecosystem projects like [VueUse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse) (see [three part series about ignorableWatch and useRefHistory](https://patak.dev/vue/ignorable-watch.html)), [Vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and others.

My current focus is on [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) maintenance, as its ecosystem and community are exploding. You'll [see me](https://github.com/patak-js) in Vite's PRs working with other collaborators to help them land their fixes and improvements, working out issues, and building up with other maintainers the Vite team. I'm also maintaining [Vite Rollup Plugins](https://vite-rollup-plugins.patak.dev/), a compatibility list for Rollup plugins.

Apart from coding, I'm interested in helping Open Source communities grow into healthy spaces for collaboration. You'll see me around in [Vite Land](https://chat.vitejs.dev/) helping others and fostering connections between the devs that are propelling the ecosystem forward, making plugins, integrations, and frameworks.

Thanks a lot to the people and companies that are helping to [make my open source work sustainable](https://www.patreon.com/patak)!

Special Shoutout to [StackBlitz](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/stackblitz-welcomes-patak/), for hiring me to work full-time on Vite ðŸ’š
